# ToastMusic

### So here's the premise:

Mr. Yeago made that same awful mistake that all English teachers make at some point in their lives, which is assigning me to write poetry.<br>
I have only one muse, and that is toast.

### These were the results:
```
I used to toast bread with a toaster
When I held the world in my hand,
But life's been a cruel roller coaster,
And today all my toast turns out tan.

In yesteryear I was a hero,
A baker acclaimed far and wide.
My golden-browned grains were of stupendous stature.
From crusts, even curmudgeons cried.

But then I met strife from a demon deranged
Who cursed me to bake boorish bread-
That sits in the toaster completely unchanged;
Now I feel I'd be better off dead.

My only true passion! My 'but dans la vie!'
Destroyed... desecrated... demolished.
I traveled the globe seeking one to repair me
While watching my dreams be abolished.

Now I sit in my kitchen while rotting away
As I long for those great days of old-
When I would make toast that would win me the day
'Stead of lying untouched growing mold.
```
### Why you're here:

I immediately put this poem to melody, then to chords.<br>
Within an hour I started writing an orchestral score.

**THIS IS WHERE YOU COME IN!!!**

I need people who can play musical instruments because we're gonna record this thing.<br>
Problem is if I don't know who's in my orchestra, things get tough.

### Why is this on github?????

I'm going to post updates to the score and parts here, as well as any other materials I deem approprate to deposit, in the forms of:
- Musescore files (.mscz)
- Audio files (.mp3, .mp4, .m4a, .wav)
- Sheet music (.pdf)<br>

Github makes keeping backups of everything easy :)

I'm so excited to do this with you!!!

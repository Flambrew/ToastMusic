# Growing Mold

### So here's the premise:

Mr. Yeago made that same awful mistake that all English teachers make at some point in their lives, which is assigning me to write poetry.<br>
I have only one muse, and that is toast.

### These were the results:
```
Growing Mold

I used to toast bread with a toaster
When I held the world in my hand,
But life's been a cruel roller coaster,
And today all my toast turns out tan.

In yesteryear I was a hero,
A baker acclaimed far and wide.
My golden-browned grains were of stupendous stature.
From crusts, even curmudgeons cried.

But then I met strife from a demon deranged
Who cursed me to bake boorish bread-
That sits in the toaster completely unchanged;
Now I feel I'd be better off dead.

My only true passion! Mon but dans la vie!
Destroyed... desecrated... demolished.
I traveled the globe seeking one to repair me
While watching my dreams disappear.

I, in my kitchen, while rotting away,
Long for those great days of old-
When I would make toast that would win me the day
'Stead of lying untouched growing mold.
```
### Why you're here:

Within an hour I started putting this to melody.

I have hence finished a score, available at https://musescore.com/user/20361241/scores/15259390.

I need people who can play musical instruments because we're gonna record this thing.<br>
Problem is if I don't know who's in my orchestra, things get tough.

(fyi I will reinstrument and make adjustments to the score based on who I have)

I'm so excited to do this with you!!!
